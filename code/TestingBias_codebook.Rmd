## Project Overview

### Main Objectives

1.  Understand how patterns of testing by vaccination status affect
    estimates of vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection
    across two study designs:

    a.  retrospective cohort design
    b.  retrospective test negative design

Explore how estimates differ across study designs given the same
sampling period and how do results differ across sampling time within
each study design,

If we find that testing differences across vaccination status can lead
to biased measurements:

2.  How is the magnitude of this bias shaped by differences levels and
    the aspects of immune escape (found across emerging variants)

    a.  Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility
    b.  Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness
    
3.  How is the magnitude of the bias shaped by the transmissibility of the virus

### Summary of Methodology

To quantify the magnitude of potential bias due to testing differences
by vaccination status, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) to derive
symptomatic VE measurements under different testing scenarios. The ABM
includes vaccination and testing and simulates SARS-Cov-2 transmission
dynamics using a contact network.

At each iteration, the model updates individuals' states, keeping track
of both fixed and changing attributes over time. Each individual
represented in the model was assigned a list of attributes including
SARS-CoV-2 status (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered), symptom status (symptomatic vs asymptomatic), level of
healthcare engagement (low vs high), vaccination status (vaccinated vs
unvaccinated), testing for SARS-CoV-2 (tested vs not tested) and
SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis given testing (tested positive vs negative). We
also tracked the presence of Covid-like symptoms due to etiologies other
than SARS-CoV-2 infection.

## Technical Overview

### R Scripts

The project involves five R scripts to run the ABM model, generate the datasets, conduct analyses and produce figures.

The following three R scripts contain the ABM model code to run the ABM to create the main datasets used in the main analyses:

1. ***ABM_Main.R***: contains the main code to run the ABM and generate datasets. This script calls on both ***ABM_mainFunctions.R*** and  ***Aggdf_mainFunctions.R***. 

2. ***ABM_mainFunctions.R***: contains code for the main ABM functions to generate the transmission network, assign healthcare engagement status, conduct transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, conduct symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing, etc. 

3. ***Aggdf_mainFunctions.R***: contains code to aggregate individual-level information to  population-level measurements.   

The following two R scripts are used to conduct the analyses and generate figures:

4. ***MainAnalyses_and_Figures.R***: contains the code to conduct the main analyses pertaining to Objectives 1-3 and to generate Figures 3-6.

5. ***AppendixAnalyses_and_Figures.R***: contains the code to conduct the supporting analyses found in the appendix and to generate Appendix Figures 1-14.

### Datasets

There are two main datasets produced by ***ABM_Main.R***:

1. *inds_df*: contains individual-level information for a timestep. This dataset is used to run the ABM and to create the information found in *agg_df*. This dataset is not saved.

2. *agg_df*, contains population-level information across timesteps
and across three testing scenarios (originally represented as three separate data
frames: *aggDF_equal*, *aggDF_modUnequal*, and *aggDF_highUnequal* that were combined). This dataset is saved and is used to generate all results and figures. Thus, all datasets found in the "data" folder in the github repository are *agg_df* datasets.

## ABM Details 

### Main Functions

These ABM functions are found in ***Aggdf_mainFunctions.R*** and are used by ***ABM_Main.R*** to run the model.

<br>

##### **Function Name:** <span style="color: purple"> _covid_Create_Matrix{}_</span>

 **Short Description:** Generates a contact matrix that sets who is connected with whom (for SARS-CoV-2 transmission) in the population.

 **Detailed Description:** Generates a contact matrix based on an
 Erdos-RÃ©nyi graph with *N* number of nodes and an average number of
 contacts based on *no.contacts*. After the network is created, the
 smaller disconnected components of the network are connected to the
 main component of the network by iterating through the list of the
 smaller network components (*list.remaining.cluster.ids*) and
randomly sampling one node in each smaller component
 (*unconnected.nodeId.sample.name*) to be connected to one randomly
 sampled node in the main network (*main.nodeId.sample.name*). A new
edgelist (*new_edge_list*) is created based on these new
connections, which is then added the main network (*contact_matrix*).
The number of contacts (i.e. degree) for each node is assigned as an
attribute of *contact_matrix*; other node attributes
are also added including covid status (Covid_status), vaccination
status (Vac_status) , and individual id (name) are then assigned based on information from *df$[t]$*.

**Inputs:** *df$[t]$* (dataframe at time *t*), *no.contacts* (numeric
scalar), *N* (numeric scalar)

**Outputs:** *contact_matrix* (matrix of scalars)

<br>

##### **Function Name:** <span style="color: purple"> *assign_HCE_Status{}*</span>

 **Short Description:** Assigns level of healthcare engagement to
 individuals ("low" indicates low healthcare engagement; and
"high" indicates high healthcare engagement) by vaccination status
 and healthcare engagement scenario.

 **Detailed Description:** Assigns level of health-seeking to each
 individual using random draws and scenario-based proportions of high
 and low health-seeking by vaccination status
 (_prop.HCE.testing.unvac_ for unvaccinated; _prop.HCE.testing.vac_
 for vaccinated). The indicator variable _level.diff_ indicates the
 healthcare engagement scenario: "1" is where vaccinated and
 unvaccinated have the same level of high health-seeking; "2" is
 where vaccinated have 2.5x higher levels of high healthcare
 engagement; and "3" is where vaccinated have 5x higher levels of
 high healthcare engagement. Individual's healthcare engagement status
 for each healthcare engagement scenario (either "low" for low healthcare
 engagement or "high" for high healthcare engagement) is saved in
 the corresponding healthcare engagement scenario variable in _df$[t]$:
 ***HCE_status_equal***, ***HCE_status_modUnequal***; and
 ***HCE_status_highUnequal***. As the vaccinated population maintains the
 same levels of high and low health-seeking across scenarios (i.e. only
 the unvaccinated population's healthcare engagement levels vary across
 scenarios), vaccinated individuals' statuses across
 ***HCE_status_equal***, ***HCE_status_modUnequal***; and
 ***HCE_status_highUnequal*** are all the same (set as
 *level.diff* = "1").

 **Inputs:** _df$[t]$_ (dataframe at time $t$), _level.diff_
 (character vector), _prop.HCE.testing.unvac_ (numeric vector),
 _prop.HCE.testing.vac_ (numeric vector)

 **Modifies:** ***HCE_status\_\**** where ***\**** = ***equal, modUnequal,
 highUnequal***

##### **Function Name:** <span style="color: purple"> *covid_Infection_Network{}* </span>

 **Assumption:** Individuals can be infected with Covid if they are
 already have symptoms from another source (i.e. when
 **Noncovid_status** == "I"). We assume that symptomatic and
 asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 can equally infect
 susceptible individuals. We also assume that there is a poisson
 distribution around latency time (**Covid_exposed_timeLength** and
 **Covid_timeLeft_exposed**). Those protected by the vaccine (i.e.
 *Covid_status* == "S_protected") cannot be infected with SARS-CoV-2.

 **Short Description:** Infects individuals with SARS-CoV-2, sets their
 SARS-CoV-2 status to exposed, and assigns the amount of time that will
 be spent in the exposed state.

 **Detailed Description:** Determines exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and sets
 the length of the latency period for each exposed individual. First,
 to determine potential exposure to an infected individual, two data
 frames are created: the first contains individual's total number of
 contacts who are infected and vaccinated (*df.infected.by.vac*) and
 the other, the total number of contacts who are infected and
 unvaccinated (*df.infected.by.vac*). These counts are assigned as
 attributes in the main network, contact_matrix
 (contact_by_inf.vac and contact_by_inf.unvac).

 Next, the function identifies those in the main network who are
 susceptible. Whether these susceptible individuals become exposed to
 SARS-CoV-2 is determined by two sets of draws from a binomial
 distribution -- one based on their vaccinated infected contacts and
 the other on their unvaccinated infected contacts. For trials related
 to their vaccinated contacts, the number of trials for each
 susceptible individual is their number of infected vaccinated
 contacts(*num. vac.inf.contacts*) and the probability of success is
the probability of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 given vaccination
 (*covid.prob.trans* with *ve.infect*); for trials related to
 unvaccinated contacts, the number of trials is their number of
 infected unvaccinated contacts (*num.unvac.inf.contacts*) and the
 probability of success is the probability of transmission for
 SARS-CoV-2 alone (*covid.prob.trans)*. If the total number of
 successes across both trials \>=1, the individual becomes exposed. For
 those who become exposed, their covid status attribute in the main
 network (*contact_matrix*) is updated (Covid_status = "E") and their
 Covid status, SARS-CoV-2 new infection and ever infected with
 SARS-CoV-2 indicator variables in the main data frame (df$[t]$) are
 also updated (**Covid_status** = "E" and **Covid_newlyExposed** = "1";
 and **Covid_everInfected** = "1").

 The function also assigns the time to be spent in the exposed state
 (**Covid_exposed_timeLength**), set using a draw from a Poisson
 distribution with an average incubation time of
 *avg.covid.inc.period*. The time left in the exposed state
 (**Covid_timeLeft_exposed**) is also assigned (and is the same as
 **Covid_exposed_timeLength**).

 **Input(s):** df$[t]$ (dataframe at time *t*), *contact_matrix* (igraph
 object), *ve.infect* (numeric scalar), *covid.prob.trans* (numeric
 scalar), *avg.covid.inc.period* (numeric scalar)

 **Modifies: Covid_status**, **Covid_newlyExposed**,
 **Covid_everInfected**, **Covid_exposed_timeLength**, and
 **Covid_timeLeft_exposed**

<br>

##### **Function:** <span style="color: purple"> *covid_ExpToInf{}* </span>

 **Assumption:** We assume there is a Poisson distribution around
 recovery time (*avg.covid.recovery.time**). Recovery time is not
 dependent on vaccination status nor symptom status. We will start by
 assuming vaccination does not influence the probability of becoming
 symptomatic (*covid.prob.sympt.vac* = *covid.prob.sympt.unvac*) but
 have enabled these probabilities to covary with vaccination status if
 we select to do so.

 **Short Description:** Moves individuals to the SARS-CoV-2 infectious
 class, assigns symptom status, and assigns amount of time to be spent
 as infectious.

 **Detailed Description:** Moves individuals from the exposed class
 ("E") to the infectious class ("I") for the covid status variable
 (**Covid_status**). Assigns whether individuals are asymptomatic or
 symptomatic (**Covid_symptomStatus**) using a Bernoulii trial using
 probabilities (*covid.prob.sympt.vac* and
 *covid.prob.sympt.unvac*) based on vaccination status
 (**Vac_status**). Those who are infected with symptomatic Covid are
 recorded (**Covid_everSymptInfected**). The total time spent in the
 infectious state is recorded (**Covid_infectious_timeLength**) along
 with the time left until recovery (**Covid_timeLeft_infectious** =
 **Covid_infectious_timeLength**). The recovery time is drawn from a
 Poisson distribution using a defined average recovery time
 (*avg.covid.recovery.time*).

 **Inputs:** df$[t]$ (dataframe at time *t*), *covid.prob.sympt.vac*
 (numeric scalar), *covid.prob.sympt.unvac* (numeric scalar),
 *avg.covid.recovery.time* (numeric scalar)

 **Modifies: Covid_status**, **Covid_symptomStatus**,
 **Covid_everSymptInfected**, **Covid_infectious_timeLength**, and
 **Covid_timeLeft_infectious**

<br>

##### **Function:** <span style="color: purple"> *recovery{}*</span>

 **Short Description:** Moves individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 to
 recovered and those with symptoms due to other etiologies to
 uninfected.

 **Detailed Description:** This function changes **Covid_status** from "I" to "R" (infectious to recovered) in the *contact_matrix* and in *df$[t]$* for those who have 0 time left until recovery from SARS-CoV-2 (determined by **Covid_timeLeft_infectious**). It also changes **Noncovid_status** from "I" to "N" (infectious/symptomatic to not infected) in *df$[t]$* for those who have 0 time left until recovery from other etiologies (determined by **Noncovid_timeLeft_infected**). For those recovering from SARS-CoV-2, symptom status(**Covid_symptomStatus**) is also reset to 0 (non-symptomatic).

**Inputs:** *df$[t]$* (dataframe at time *t*)

**Modifies: Covid_status**, **Covid_symptomStatus**,**Noncovid_status**, *contact_matrix*

<br>

##### **Function:** <span style="color: purple"> *nonCovid_Infection{}*</span>

 **Assumptions:** We assume individuals who are infected with
 SARS-Cov-2 can also be symptomatic due to other etiologies(and vice
 versa). We assume there is always x prevalence in the population (set
 by *noncovid.prop.infect* outside the function).All individuals can
 have symptoms due to other etiologies at different periods across
 time. All individuals with symptoms due to other etiologies are
 symptomatic. Recovery time (*avg.noncovid.recovery.time*) is assumed
 to follow a Poisson distribution.

 **Short Description:** Recruits individuals to be symptomatic due to
 other etiologies, sets their status to be infected and assigns the
 amount of time until individual becomes non-symptomatic again.

 **Detailed Description:** Sets individuals to be symptomatic based on
 how many individuals have recovered from symptoms due to other
 etiologies and therefore need to be replaced (set by
 *noncovid.replace*)to maintain the prevalence in the population.
 Individuals who are to become symptomatic due to other etiologies are
 selected through random sampling (using *noncovid.replace* to set
 the number to be sampled); The possible replacement candidates who are
 sampled from are those not currently symptomatic due to other etiologies.

 If individuals are selected to be symptomatic due to other etiologies,
 their non-covid status their new symptomatic infection due to other
 etiologies and their ever symptomatic due to other etiologies
 indicator variables are all updated (**Noncovid_status** = "I";
 **NonCovid_newlyInfected** = "1"; and **NonCovid_everSymptInfected** = "1").

 The function also assigns the length of recovery time
 (**Noncovid_infected_timeLength**), set using a draw from a Poisson
 distribution with an average number of recovery days of
 *avg.noncovid.recovery.time*. The time left being symptomatic due to
 other etiologies (**Noncovid_timeLeft_infected**) is also assigned
 (and is the same as **Noncovid_infected_timeLength**).

 **Input:** *df$[t]$* (dataframe at time *t*), *noncovid.replace*
 (numeric scalar), *avg.noncovid.recovery.time* (numeric scalar)

 **Modifies: Noncovid_status**, **NonCovid_newlyInfected**,
 **NonCovid_everSymptInfected**, **Noncovid_infected_timeLength**, and
 **Noncovid_timeLeft_infected**

<br>

##### **Function:** <span style="color: purple">*covid_Testing{}*</span>

 **Assumptions:** Individuals who are symptomatic are eligible to be
 tested. Everyone can only test once per timestep, but each individual
 can test multiple times across time. We assume that the probability of
 getting tested while symptomatic due to Covid-19 or due to other
 etiologies (*covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* = *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.
 vac* and *covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac* =
 *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac*) and that testing can vary by
 vaccination status (**vac_Status**). Finally, we define a false
 positive result (**Covid_falseSymptPos**) as individuals who test
 positive for Covid-19 when they are exposed or infected with
 asymptomatic covid while having symptoms due to other etiologies (and
 no symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2). The actual test is assumed to have
 perfect sensitivity and specificity.

 **Short Description:** Sets which symptomatic individuals infected
 with SARS-CoV-2 tested for SARS-CoV-2 (and sets them testing
 positive); also tracks whether individuals receive a false positive
 (when asymptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 but symptomatic due to other
 etiologies).

 **Detailed Description:** This function determines who gets tested for
 individuals are symptomatic and infected with Covid (**Covid_status**
 ="E" or **Covid_status** ="I") regardless of whether they are symptomatic due to other etiologies or not (**Noncovid_status** ="N" or **Noncovid_status**
 ="I"). This function keeps track of how many times individuals
 tested when exposed or infectious with Covid-19
 (**Covid_testedSymptExp\_\*** or **Covid_testedSymptInf\_\***), and
 the time step they were tested (**Covid_newly_testedSymptExp\_\*** or
 **Covid_newly_testedSymptInf\_\***) based on their levels of testing
 (*levels.tested -* 1 = equal testing, 2= moderately unequal testing,
 and 3 = highly unequal testing).

 Individual testing for those who have symptomatic Covid
 (**Covid_symptomStatus** = "symptomatic") is determined by a
 Bernoulli draw where the probability of being tested set by
 *covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac* (for unvaccinated) and
*covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* (for vaccinated); individual testing who
 are exposed to Covid-19 (**Covid_status** ="E") or have
 asymptomatic Covid-19 (**Covid_status** ="I" &
 **Covid_symptomStatus** = "asymptomatic") and also have Covid-like
 symptoms (**Noncovid_status** ="**I**") is determined by a Bernoulli
 draw where the probability of being tested is set by
 *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac* (for unvaccinated) and
*non.covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* (for vaccinated). Note that
 *covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac*, *covid.prob.test.sympt.vac*,
 *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac* and *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* are vectors of probabilities. For unvaccinated individuals, their vectors (*covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* and *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.vac*) contain probabilities
that correspond to increasing differences in the levels of testing
compared to vaccinated -- equal, moderately unequal and highly
 unequal- indicated by *levels.tested* (1 = equal, 2= moderately
unequal, and 3 = highly unequal); for vaccinated individuals, their
vectors (*covid.prob.test.sympt. unvac* and *non.covid.prob.test.sympt. unvac*) contain identical probabilities despite the testing labels indicating equal, modUnequal and highUnequal.

 False positive tests are also tracked (**Covid_falseSymptPos**), which
 arise either when individuals are exposed with Covid-19
 (**Covid_status** ="E") or asymptomatic with Covid-19
 (**Covid_status** ="I" & **Covid_symptomStatus** =
 "asymptomatic") while also having symptoms due to other etiologies
 (**Noncovid_status** ="I"). A false positive can be reset if the
 individual retests with symptomatic Covid-19 (only occurs when the
 false positive arose during Covid-19 exposure.

 **Inputs:** *df$[t]$* (dataframe at time *t*), *levels.tested*
 (character vector), *covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac* (numeric vector),
 *covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* (numeric vector) ,
 *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac* (numeric vector),
 *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* (numeric vector).

 **Modifies: Covid_newly_testedSymptExp\_\***,
 **Covid_testedSymptExp\_\***, **Covid_newly_testedSymptInf\_\***,
 **Covid_testedSymptInf\_\*, Covid_falseSymptPos\_\*** where **\*** =
 **equal, modUnequal, highUnequal**

<br>

##### **Function:** <span style="color: purple">*nonCovid_Testing{}* </span>

 **Assumptions:** All individuals who have symptoms due to other
etiologies (**Noncovid_Status** = "I") are assumed to be
symptomatic and therefore all have the potential to test. Each
individual can only test once per timestep but individuals can be
tested more than once across time. In our analysis we assume that the
probability of getting tested while symptomatic is the same when
having symptoms due to Covid-19 or other etiologies
(*covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* = *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* and
*covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac* = *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac*) and
that testing can vary by vaccination status (**vac_Status**). The
actual test is assumed to have perfect sensitivity and specificity.

 **Short Description:** Sets which symptomatic individuals due to other
etiologies tested for SARS-CoV-2 (and sets them to testing negative);
 also tracks whether individuals receive a false negative (when
 individuals have previously had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 but were not
 tested).

 **Detailed Description:** This function determines who gets tested
 when individuals have symptoms due to other etiologies
(**Noncovid_Status** = "I") but who are not co-infected (i.e. also
are exposed or infectious with covid). It keeps track of how many
 times individuals get tested when they have symptoms due to other
 etiologies (**NonCovid_testedSymptInf\_\***) and the time step they
 were tested (**NonCovid_newly_testedSymptInf\_\***)**.** by testing
 level (*levels.tested*).

 Individual testing for those only having symptoms due to other
 etiologies is determined by a Bernoulli draw where the probability of
 being tested (*non.covid.prob.test.sympt.vac*, *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac*) varies by vaccination status (**vac_Status**). Note that *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac* and *non.covid.prob.test.sympt.vac* are vectors of probabilities. For vaccinated individuals, their vector (*non.covid.prob.test.sympt.vac*) contains probabilities that correspond to increasing levels of testing -- equal, moderately unequal and highly unequal - indicated by *levels.tested* (1 = equal, 2= moderately unequal, and 3 = highly unequal); for
 unvaccinated individuals, their vector (*non.covid.prob.test.sympt.unvac*) contains identical probabilities despite the testing labels indicating equal, moderately unequal and highly unequal.

 False negative tests are also tracked (**Covid_falseNeg**), which
 arise either when individuals have been previously infected with
 symptomatic Covid-19 (**Covid_status** ="I" &
 **Covid_symptomStatus** = "symptomatic") and have not previously
 tested positive for symptomatic Covid (**Covid_testedSymptInf_unvac**
 or **Covid_testedSymptInf_vac**). A false negative cannot be changed
 over time as the symptomatic infection was not accounted for during
 the window of opportunity to capture it.

11. Increase timestep by 1

## Dataset Details

### _inds_df Dataset_ 

#### Rownames

Rownames contain the identifier for each individual in the format
"indx" with x representing the individual's unique id number.

#### Columnnames (Variable Names) 

-   **Vac_status**\<- vaccination status against infection from
    SARS-CoV-2. Options include "vac" (vaccinated) and "unvac"
    (unvaccinated).

-   **t\<-** the current timestep.

##### SARS-CoV-2 Infection Variables

-   **Covid_status** \<- what is the status of COVID-19 infection. The
    options include S (susceptible), S_protected (susceptible but
    protected due to the vaccine), E (exposed), I (infectious), and R
    (recovered).

-   **Covid_newlyExposed** \<- binary indicator if this is the time
    point when individuals became exposed (i.e. infected) with
    SARS-CoV-2.

##### Testing & Healthcare Engagement Variables

All variable names listed below are associated with three separate
variables with the extension "equal", "modUnequal" and "highUnequal".
These extensions are related to the difference in the level of
testing where "equal" is equal testing, "modUnequal" is 1.76x higher testing, and "highUnequal" is 2.36x higher testing for vaccinated compared to unvaccinated.These testing differences stem from healthcare engagement differences where vaccinated individuals have either the same equal, 2.5x higher or 5x higher probabilities of having high healthcare engagement than their unvaccinated counterparts ("equal", "modUnequal" and "highUnequal") combined with the probability of testing given high or low healthcare engagement (high = 0.85 chance of testing; low=0.15 chance of testing). 

-   **Covid_testedSymptExp** \<- how many times an individual has been
    tested for Covid-19 while exposed to Covid19 while also having
    symptoms due to other etiologies (and categorized as positive).

-   **Covid_newly_testedSymptExp** \<-individual has been tested for
    Covid-19 while exposed to Covid-19 and also have symptoms due to
    other etiologies (and categorized as positive) at this time-step.

-   **Covid_newly_testedSymptInf** \<-individual has been tested for
    Covid-19 while infectious and symptomatic (and categorized as
    positive) at this time-step. Individuals will be counted if they are
    symptomatic whether it is due to symptomatic Covid-19 or when
    asymptomatic or exposed to Covid-19 and co-infected with symptoms
    due to other etiologies.

-   **Covid_testedSymptInf** \<- number of times an individual has been
    tested for Covid-19 while infectious with symptomatic (and
    categorized as positive). Individuals will be counted if they are
    EITHER symptomatic due to Covid-19 or when asymptomatic or exposed
    to Covid-19 but co-infected with symptoms due to other etiologies.
    This is used in the calculated version of VE against symptomatic
    infection.

-   **Covid_falseSymptPos**\<-indicates whether individuals have been
    tested while only exposed to Covid-19 or have asymptomatic Covid-19
    while co-infected with symptoms due to other etiologies. Here the
    presence of symptoms are due to factors other than SARS-CoV-2 (Note:
    The number of false positives should be negligible).

-   **NonCovid_testedSymptInf** \<- number of times an individual has
    been tested for Covid-19 while only having symptoms due to other
    etiologies (will be classified as negative). This is used in the
    aggregate dataset to help calculate VE against symptomatic infection
    when using a test negative design.

-   **NonCovid_newly_testedSymptInf** \<-individual tested for Covid-19
    while only having symptoms due to other etiologies (and categorized
    as negative) at this time-step.

-   **Covid_falseNeg**\<- indicates whether individuals have been tested
    due to symptoms from other etiologies (and classified as negative)
    when they have previously been infected with symptomatic Covid
    (**Covid_everSymptInfected** = "1") but never received a positive
    symptomatic COVID-19 test (**Covid_testedSymptInf** = "0").

-   **HCE_status**\<-indicates whether individuals have high
    healthcare engagement ("high") or low healthcare engagement ("low"). This
    variable is typically associated with whether individuals are likely
    or unlikely to engage in SARS-CoV-2 testing ("low").

-   **NonCovid_cumSymptInfect_tested_unvac** \<- cumulative measure of the
    number of *unvaccinated* individuals who tested when having Covid-like
    symptoms due to other etiologies who are not currently infected by
    Covid-19 nor have ever tested positive when symptomatic and infected
    with Covid-19. This measure excludes individuals who previously tested
    while having symptoms from other etiologies but who were also exposed to
    Covid-19 or had asymptomatic Covid-19.

-   **NonCovid_cumSymptInfect_tested_vac** \<- cumulative measure of the
    number of *vaccinated* individuals who tested when having Covid-like
    symptoms due to other etiologies who are not currently infected by
    Covid-19 nor have ever tested positive when symptomatic and infected
    with Covid-19. This measure excludes individuals who previously tested
    while having symptoms from other etiologies but who were also exposed to
    Covid-19 or had asymptomatic Covid-19.

##### Observed Vaccine Effectiveness Variables

-   **VE_symptRR_observed** \<- measure of observed vaccine effectiveness
    against symptomatic Covid-19 infection using the estimated relative risk
    (1 - relative risk$_O$ *[RR$_O$]*) where *RR$_O$* is defined as 1 -
    (**Covid_cumSymptExpInfect_tested_vac** /*N.vac*)/
    (**Covid_cumSymptExpInfect_tested_unvac** /*N.unvac*) where *N.vac*
    and *N.unvac* are the total numbers of vaccinated and unvaccinated
    individuals in the population, respectively. As this measure uses
    observed cumulative symptomatic infections, it may be influenced by
    false positives and false negatives.

-   **VE_symptOR_observed** \<- measure of observed vaccine effectiveness
    against symptomatic Covid-19 infection using the estimated odds ratio (1 - odds         ratio$_O$ *[OR$_O$]*) where *OR$_O$* is defined as 1 -
    (**Covid_cumSymptExpInfect_tested_vac** /
    **NonCovid_cumSymptInfect_tested_vac**)/
    (**Covid_cumSymptExpInfect_tested_unvac** /
    **NonCovid_cumSymptInfect_tested_unvac**). As this measure uses observed
    cumulative symptomatic infections, it may be influenced by false
    positives and false negatives.

-   **VE_symptRR_degUnder_peak_trueVeff**\<- a measure of how much observed
    vaccine effectiveness (calculated using relative risk) underestimates
    true vaccine efficacy against susceptibility at the peak of an epidemic.

    vaccine effectiveness (calculated using odds ratio) underestimates true
    vaccine efficacy against susceptibility at the peak of an epidemic.

-   **VE_symptRR_degUnder_peak_targEst**\<- a measure of how much observed
    vaccine effectiveness (calculated using relative risk) underestimates
    the target estimate of vaccine effectiveness (calculated using relative
    risk with everyone in the population) at the peak of an epidemic.

-   **VE_symptOR_degUnder_peak_targEst**\<- a measure of how much observed
    vaccine effectiveness (calculated using odds ratio) underestimates the
    target estimate of vaccine effectiveness (calculated using odds ratio
    with everyone in the population) at the peak of an epidemic.

##### Indicator Variables

-   **Label_veSusc** \<- a string in the form "VE Susc.= x" where "x"
    indicates the true vaccine efficacy against susceptibility.

-   **Label_veInfect** \<- a string in the form "VE Infect.= y" where "y"
