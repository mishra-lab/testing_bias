### Description:
All datasets listed in this folder are called in by AppendixAnalyses_and_Figures.R to generate the figures and analyses found in the appendix. 

### Datasets Overview:
- *aggDF.ves0.1.csv*: contains quantile summaries for select variables (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%), aggregated from the 100 csv files when vaccine efficacy against susceptibility is lower (located in the *obj.1_ve.susc.0.1* folder)
- *aggDF.ves0.55.csv*: contains quantile summaries for select variables (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%), aggregated from the 100 csv files when vaccine efficacy against susceptibility is higher (located in the *obj.1_ve.susc.0.55* folder)
- *df.vs.susc0.1_other.etiologies.sens.high.csv*:  
- *df.vs.susc0.55_other.etiologies.sens.high.csv*:
- *df.ves0.1_highChange.peak.csv*: contains all variables sampled at the point of highest epidemic growth and at the epidemic peak, compiled from each of the 100 csv files when vaccine efficacy against susceptibility is lower (located in the *obj.1_ve.susc.0.1* folder)
- *df.ves0.55_highChange.peak.csv*: contains all variables sampled at the point of highest epidemic growth and at the epidemic peak, compiled from each of the 100 csv files when vaccine efficacy against susceptibility is higher (located in the *obj.1_ve.susc.0.55* folder)
- *sens.analyses* datasets: contains quantile summaries for select variables (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) across varying levels of efficacy against susceptibility, efficacy against infectiousness and probability of transmission
