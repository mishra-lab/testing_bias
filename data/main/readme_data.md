### Description: 
All data found in these folders are simulated data produced using ABM_Main.R (located in the "Code" folder). All of these dataseets are used by MainAnalyses_and_Figures.R to create the main figures in the manuscript. 

### Data Overview:
- *obj1_aggDF.ves0.55.csv* and *obj1_aggDF.ves0.1.csv* contain the simulated data required to address objective 1. These data are used to produce figure 3.
- *obj2_ve.susc.sens.csv* contain the simulated data required to address part 1 of objective 2. These data are used to produce figure 4.
- *obj2_ve.infect.sens_ve.susc.0.55* and *obj2_ve.infect.sens_ve.susc.0.1* contain the simulated data required to address part 2 of objective 2. These data are used to produce figure 5.
- *obj3_prob.trans.sens_ve.susc.0.55* and *obj3_prob.trans.sens_ve.susc.0.1* contain the simulated data required to address objective 3. These data are used to produce figure 6.
