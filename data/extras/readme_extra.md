### Folder Overview:

- *obj.1_ve.susc.0.1*: includes 100 csv files (individual epidemic realizations) when vaccine efficacy against susceptibility is lower
- *obj.1_ve.susc.0.55*: includes 100 csv files (individual epidemic realizations) when vaccine efficacy against susceptibility is higher.
- *obj.2&3_sens.analyses*: includes 5 csv files that contain all variables across levels of efficacy against susceptibility, efficacy against infectiousness and probability of transmission.
- *appendices*: includes a csv file that contains individual stats coefficients, p-values and standard errors from the Cox and logistic regression models. This dataset relates to the analyses for estimating VE when accounting for time for both higher and lower vaccine efficacy against susceptibility (0.1 and 0.55).
